	<p>Online/offline events could not be trigger programatically, so they have to be tested manually. To test behaviour of network monitor button, go offline and online again by doing the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Firefox</strong>: Main menu → Tools → Work Offline</li>
		<li><strong>IE9</strong>: File → Work offline</li>
		<li><strong>IE10</strong>: Tools → Work Offline</li>
		<li><strong>Opera 12 and below</strong>: Settings → Work Offline</li>
		<li><strong>Chrome, Safari, IE11+, Opera 15+</strong>: No easy way. The fastest way is switching your network connection off and on via the controls your OS provides.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Button label should be "This device seems to be disconnected from the web" in offline mode, and "This device seems to be connected to the web" when you're online.</p>

	<p>If network monitor button is not visible, this means it's not supported in this browser.</p>
