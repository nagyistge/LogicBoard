			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>
				This page describes which libraries, present in this project's <a href="https://github.com/cezarykluczynski/simone">repository</a>, should be upgraded, how, and when. If you think some of this guidelines should be changed, feel free to <a gref="code.html#discussions">start discussion</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				All libraries can be found in <a href="https://github.com/cezarykluczynski/simone/tree/master/libs"><code>libs</code></a> directory of this repository.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Important:</strong> As long as this repository is in active development, there are people how will keep all libraries up to date. This page serves more as a guidelines for whoever want's to fork or take over this project in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally, it's preferred to have the development, uncompressed versions of libraries.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> When downloading new versions, include only those files that are already included.
			</p>

			<span id="filesaver" class="anchor-fix"></span>

			<span id="jquery" class="anchor-fix"></span>
			<h2>jQuery and jQuery UI</h2>

			<p>
				Whenever a new stable version is released, either maintenance or major, it should be added to repository. Create new directory with name reflecting version number and add full production versions of jQuery or jQuery UI (and jQuery UI Sunny theme, and also a full list of datapicker translations). Refer to <code>libs/jquery</code> and <code>libs/jquery-ui</code> directories to see the exact files structure, and mimic itâ€”otherwise, file will not be included correctly in <a href="tests.html">tests</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				After adding new files to subdirectory, replace files in main directory of either <code>libs/jquery</code> or <code>libs/jquery-ui</code>, so head version can be the newest (the one called in test when no version is specified).
			</p>
			<p>
				When upgrading jQuery UI, change paths in <code>libs/jui_theme_switch/official.json</code> to match latest version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, add new version to <code>config/tests.json</code> file, and change appropriate value of <code class="language-javascript">"head"</code> key to match the latest version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do some tests and bugfixes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Add new versions to <a href="installation.html">installation</a> page. Tag new version appropriately. Use <span class="fam tick"></span><code class="language-html">"fam tick"</code> class to tag supported version, <span class="fam cross"></span><code class="language-html">"fam cross"</code> to tag unsupported version of library, and <span class="fam hourglass"></span><code class="language-html">"fam hourglass"</code> to tag version for which decision on the matter is pending.
